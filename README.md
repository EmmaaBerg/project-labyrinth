# Project Labyrinth

This weeks project was to use API calls using thunks in Redux to create a maze game. 

## The problem
We started the week by making a plan how the code should be structured. 
We used thunks to wrap our API calls and we also implemented Lottie for an animation loader to show the user when waiting for the fetch. 

At first we stuggled with moving from the first API call to the next, but we got some help from our team and managed to solve it. At the end we had some problems with the structure of our styled components, so if we would have more time we would try to make more global styling and reusable components to avoid DRY.
